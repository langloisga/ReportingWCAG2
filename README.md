## Background

The Secretary of the Treasury Board announced in January 2010 that the existing CLF 2.0 Standards 
would be replaced by three new standards: the Standard on Web Accessibility, the Standard on Web Usability,
and the Standard on Web Interoperability. This announcement signalled that the Government of Canada would 
move towards adopting WCAG 2.0 - the most current internationally recognized guidelines on Web accessibility.  

**Government of Canada Web Standards and Guidelines**
* *Standard on Web Accessibility* (http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601&section=text)
* *Standard on Web Usability* (http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=24227&section=text)
* *Guidance on Implementing the Standard on Web Accessibility* (http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/ws-nw/wa-aw/wa-aw-guid-eng.asp)
* *Guidance on Implementing the Standard on Web Usability* (http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=24370)
* *WET Template* (https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew)

## Benefits of using Web Experience Toolkit (WET) include:
* Reduce costs using ready-made Web tools and solutions for building and maintaining innovative websites (including Web applications).
* Decrease website (including Web applications) development times by using a wide range of supported website (including Web applications) layouts and designs.
* Use existing website (including Web applications) features that respect accessibility (WCAG 2.0 AA and WAI-ARIA), usability, and interoperability.
* Apply advanced and innovative technologies to push the envelope for website (including Web applications) functionality:
        HTML5, CSS3, jQuery (JavaScript framework);
        Ever-growing list of open source plugins and widgets.
* Use open source software that is free for use by institutions and external Web communities.

Build Web pages using the most recent version of the [Web Experience Toolkit (WET)] (https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew) is
highly recommended. WET is a collection of ready-made tools and solutions for building and maintaining 
innovative websites (including Web applications) that are accessible, usable, and interoperable.
